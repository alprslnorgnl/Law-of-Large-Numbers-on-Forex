# Law of Large Numbers on Forex
It is a study in which I try to prove the law of large numbers, one of the basic principles of probability in the forex market.

### What is Law of Large Numbers?
The Law of Large Numbers is a fundamental principle in probability and statistics that describes the behavior of the average of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables. In simpler terms, it states that as the sample size increases, the average of the sample will tend to get closer to the expected value or true population mean.

The Law of Large Numbers is based on the idea that random fluctuations tend to cancel out as the sample size becomes larger, resulting in a more stable and predictable average. This principle is essential for making inferences and drawing conclusions from data.

There are two main versions of the Law of Large Numbers:

1. Weak Law of Large Numbers: This version states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean will converge in probability to the true population mean. In other words, as you take larger and larger random samples from a population, the sample means will get closer to the actual population mean, but there will still be some random variation around it.

2. Strong Law of Large Numbers: This version is more powerful and asserts that as the sample size approaches infinity, the sample mean will almost surely converge to the true population mean. This means that with certainty, the sample mean will eventually become equal to the population mean as the sample size becomes infinitely large.
